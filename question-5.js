/*  
What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer:
it's O(n^2) bacause we're using the nested loop, which means 
- the outer loop will run n times
- the inner loop also has to run n times for each iteration of the outer loop
so the total is n * n = n^2
